        within the company. He named the software after the Dutch painter Piet

        >In December 1989, Van Rossum had been looking for a "'hobby'
        programming project that would keep [him] occupied during the week
        around Christmas" as his office was closed when he decided to write an
        interpreter for a "new scripting language [he] had been thinking about
        lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers". He
        attributes choosing the name "Python" to "being in a slightly irreverent
        mood (and a big fan of <mark>Monty Python's Flying Circus</mark>)".[32]
        He has explained that Python's predecessor, ABC, was inspired by SETL,
        noting that ABC co-developer Lambert Meertens had "spent a year with the
        SETL group at NYU before coming up with the final ABC design".</i
